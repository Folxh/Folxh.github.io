5. Under "Build and deployment", under "Branch", use the branch dropdown menu and select a publishing source. (usually main, if not it is okay)

## Credits
This is a fork from vividelitezz's ChitChatUnblocker. However, almost everything was changed except the ultraviolet stuff. I am not saying that this code is completely mine, but most (If not all) of the orginal CCU code was replaced.
