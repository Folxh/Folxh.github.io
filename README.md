# EZ-Static

Fully static proxy that *actually works*

Currently, this only works when deployed on the root github pages site (user.github.io) 

To use, simply fork this project and deploy it to github pages (settings>pages>deploy to main branch)

based (loosly) on vividelitezz ChitChatUnblocker, although not really, almost everything was changed exept the ultraviolet stuff.
